> **v2.0.0** — This card unifies and replaces the previous standalone cards ([plex-recently-added-card](https://github.com/rusty4444/plex-recently-added-card), [kodi-recently-added-card](https://github.com/rusty4444/kodi-recently-added-card), [jellyfin-recently-added-card](https://github.com/rusty4444/jellyfin-recently-added-card), [emby-recently-added-card](https://github.com/rusty4444/emby-recently-added-card)) into a single card with a server type selector, themed accents, inline trailer playback, and swipe navigation.

---

## Features

- **Multi-server support** — Plex, Kodi, Jellyfin, and Emby, selected from a dropdown in the visual editor
- **Inline trailer playback** — trailers play directly inside the card (not a popup overlay), powered by the YouTube IFrame API
- **Themed accents** — each server type has its own default colours and logo, plus selectable colour presets (Midnight Blue, Sunset, Forest, and more)
- **Swipe navigation** — swipe left/right on touch devices or click-and-drag on desktop to move through the carousel
- **Cinematic design** — blurred background art, poster on left, info on right, smooth crossfade transitions
- **Auto-cycling carousel** — rotates through recently added items with colour-coded dots (movie/TV)
- **Synopsis and metadata** — title, year, genres, content rating, star rating, time since added, and full synopsis
- **Visual editor** — configure everything from the HA UI with dynamic fields per server type
- **Fill height / fixed height** — adapts to any HA layout mode
- **TMDB trailers** — fetches trailers for movies and TV shows via TMDB API (optional)

### Inline Trailers

Click the **Trailer** button and it plays right inside the card:

## How It Works

The card connects directly to your media server's API from the browser and fetches recently added content:

- **Plex**: Discovers library sections, then fetches recently added items from each movie and TV show library
- **Kodi**: Uses JSON-RPC to call `VideoLibrary.GetRecentlyAddedMovies` and `VideoLibrary.GetRecentlyAddedEpisodes`
- **Jellyfin**: Calls the `/Users/{userId}/Items/Latest` endpoint filtered by movie and series types
- **Emby**: Same approach as Jellyfin with Emby's API endpoints

Items are interleaved (movie, show, movie, show...) and displayed in a cycling carousel with smooth crossfade transitions.

### Important Notes

- The card makes API calls **from the browser**, not from the HA server. Your media server URL must be reachable from the device viewing the dashboard.
- If HA is served over **HTTPS** and your media server is on plain **HTTP**, browsers will block the requests (mixed content). Either access both over HTTPS, or use Plex's built-in `.plex.direct` HTTPS URLs.
- For **CORS issues** behind a reverse proxy (e.g., Nginx Proxy Manager), add `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` headers to your proxy config.
- Kodi username/password values entered through the visual editor support special characters, including non-ASCII characters. If Kodi still fails to load, open your browser developer tools on the Home Assistant dashboard and check the Console/Network tabs for the card's request error.

## Swipe Navigation

On touch devices, swipe left or right on the card to move through items. On desktop, click and drag left/right. The auto-cycle timer resets after each swipe.

---

## Migrating from the Standalone Cards

If you're currently using one of the standalone cards (e.g., `plex-recently-added-card`), switching is straightforward:

1. Install this card via HACS or manually
2. Edit your existing card and change the type:
   ```yaml
   # Old
   type: custom:plex-recently-added-card
   
   # New
   type: custom:recently-added-media-card
   server_type: plex
   ```
3. All other config options (`plex_url`, `plex_token`, `movies_count`, etc.) stay the same
4. Optionally add a `theme` to customise the look

The standalone cards will continue to work but won't receive new features.

## Known Issues

- **Geo-restricted trailers**: Some trailers may show "Video unavailable — The uploader has not made this video available in your country." This is a YouTube/TMDB restriction and cannot be fixed by the card.
- **Mixed content (HTTPS/HTTP)**: If your HA is on HTTPS and your media server is on HTTP, browsers block the requests. Use HTTPS for both, or use Plex's `.plex.direct` URLs.
